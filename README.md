# Overview
BarbarianGymStatistics is a project designed to help gym-goers find the least crowded times to visit their gym. The idea originated from the need to avoid crowded periods and ensure ample oxygen supply, especially as temperatures rise in Cyprus. By collecting data on the current number of people in the gym at regular intervals, the project aims to identify the times with the fewest attendees.

# Project History
The project started when I realized that it was getting quite hot in Cyprus, and I preferred going to the gym when it was less crowded. To achieve this, I performed a pentest on the gym's application to discover the request that retrieves the current number of people in the gym. Using this information, I developed a program that collects these data every 30 minutes. The collected data is then used to create a graph to find the times with the lowest attendance.
